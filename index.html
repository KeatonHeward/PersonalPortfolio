        <h2>About me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            I love to do a lot of things im always trying out new activities to see if I like them. I have only a few hobbies that i have tried and that i have stuck with. Those are Longbaording and playing video games.
            Longboarding has been a favortie of mine for atleast 8 years. I have always like finding a nice trail to ride on, throw on some music and have a great time just cruising. You start to love the smoothness of the wheels against the pavement and the feeling as you carve left and right.
            Video games has been my source of entertainment for a long time. its a great stress reliever and a great way to get lost in whatever world you would like to.
